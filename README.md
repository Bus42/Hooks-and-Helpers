# Hooks-and-Helpers
Useful code junk for JS/react.

I will likely turn this into a demo page for the helpers and components I've created. Right now it's just sort of a bucket full of code.
For any dependencies, make sure to look at the import section at the top of the files. I'll work on this README more, just started putting enough stuff in here to share it.
